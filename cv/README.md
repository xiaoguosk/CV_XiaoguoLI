This is my CV. Inspired by:

* [Jian Xu's CV](http://www.jianxu.net/en/files/JianXu_CV.pdf)
* [How to write a LaTeX class file and design your own CV](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_write_a_LaTeX_class_file_and_design_your_own_CV_(Part_1))

If you want to use this template for your CV, you need to also update the `cv.xmpdata` file.
